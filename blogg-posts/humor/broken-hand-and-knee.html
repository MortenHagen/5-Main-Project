            broke 2 bones in my right hand while on a skiing trip in Colorado, USA. As a Norwegian with the “europeiske” travel insurance, you're treated like a black-card patient in the states. I skipped the line even though my hand could have waited. Well well, I got x-rays and since the hand didn’t seam to need surgery, and I was going back to Norway the very next day, we decided that they gave me a “splint” instead of a cast. And I were supposed to go to the doctor in Norway when I got back home to have a final voice if there was needed to have a cast or not.

            So I went home. Travel was about 20 hours, and we landed 10.00 (10am) in Norway. I almost did not sleep anything on the plane and was super jet-lagged after I got back inside my own doorstep. So I thought to myself, “how shall I keep awake until sundown?”. And figured ill just go to the hospital straight away. Cause I’m not going to be able to sleep in those uncomfortable chairs.
This was late January and there high season for the ice- and slippery-injuries. So I sat there for a while. When I finally got in to the doctors office I gave him the envelope I got at the American hospital including my x-ray pictures. The doctor took a quick look at it and said he cant accept these  documents because their from a different computer-system, and another language. Therefore he explains to me I had been sitting for nearly 3 hours in the wrong queue, because of my documents are not valid in his opinion.
