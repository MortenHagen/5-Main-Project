        <h2>When i told the doctor to go f*** himself...</h2>
        <li>While skiing in Colorado, USA, I managed to break two bones in my right hand. Luckily, being a Norwegian with European travel insurance, I did receive VIP-like treatment in the States. Even despite the low urgency and my hand didn’t hurt that much, I was fast-tracked through the hospital queue. X-rays revealed no need for immediate surgery, so they fitted me with a splint instead of a cast. And the plan was to consult a doctor back in Norway for final decisions. They handed me an envelope containing my x-ray images along with paperwork detailing the consultations and their diagnosis.</li>
        <li>After a sleepless 20-hour journey, I arrived home at 10 am, jet-lagged and desperate to stay awake until evening to defeat the jet-lag.  I asked, "How will I stay awake until sundown?" it dawned on me—I should head straight to the hospital. After all, there was no way I could catch any sleep in those uncomfortable chairs. And as this was late January, the peak season for ice-related injuries, so I settled in for what I knew would be a wait. After about 3 hours I was called to the doctor's office, I handed over the envelope from the American hospital containing my x-ray pictures. After a brief glance, the doctor shook his head, explaining that he couldn't accept the documents due to their originating from a different computer system and being in another language. Frustratingly, what I heard was he telling me that I had wasted nearly three hours in the wrong queue because, in his view, my documents were invalid. A little frustrated, I pleaded for the doctor's professional opinion arguing that a picture is not a language. But to no avail. The doctor insisted on a fresh x-ray before he could say if he shall give me a cast or not.</li>
        <li>Oblivious to the fact that the American images in his hands will be identical to the pictures he was demanding. So after a little back and forth I got enraged by the absurdity of the situation, I lashed out, damning both the doctor and the Norwegian hospital system.</li>
        <li>Drawing from past experience of a similar injury, I knew how this kind of cast should be. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and just fix a cast myself. Storming out of the hospital, I  chose to skip across a field instead of walking the road. On this path I encountered a fence, about 50 cm high. I can easily leap to save myself a 50 meter detour. So, despite my right arm being in a sling, I attempted to jump over a fence. Mid-air,	 my left foot became ensnared, causing me to tumble forward, but with my hand immobilized, I couldn't break my fall, resulting in a hard landing on my right knee straight to the asphalt, fracturing a piece inside the knee.</li>
        <li>Ye. So there I stood, with a broken knee that also needed stitches. And I just told the doctor to go fuck himself..</li>
