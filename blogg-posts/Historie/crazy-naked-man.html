        <h2>The Crazy Naked man who stalked us in my childhood.</h2>
        <li>My life started brutally. After my parents had gone their separate ways, my mother lived with my grandparents, broke, but had gotten a job as an accountant. And that’s where I was born. After a year she bough her own place, a 50m2 apartment in a townhouse in Drøbak, witch did cost 300,000,- in 1994. I don’t remember the circumstances exactly, but it was one of the neighbors who physically handed my mother the keys when we moved in. </li>
        <li>In the beginning there was nothing weird happening. My mother and I lived there and I have a lot of good memories form this apartment. But after a while, things began to disappear. And then after some time they were back in their place. So my mother though she was going crazy at first. </li>
        <li>Things disappear, my mother searches for the item, she gets frustrated that she just can’t find it. And then suddenly it just reappears where it was supposed to be in the first place, where my mother had sworn she left it. Until one time that a shelf decoration disappeared. And my mother re-ordered all the furniture in the living-room. Then after a couple of days, in the morning when we woke up, the decoration-item suddenly was lying on the coffee-table.</li>
        <li>This became the major event that made my mother realize that there was actually someone entering our apartment physically walking inside our living-room while we slept. So she changed the front-door lock, and I have to give her credit for how calmly she behaved towards me as a 3-4-year-old during this event.</li>
        <li>Today I remember the event as a bit creepy, but also a bit exciting actually. I got to build traps in the hallway in the evening, like if someone came in they suddenly got a log in the head. Sometimes I made it basically impossible to get in through the front-door, but also my mother found one or two times she truly had difficulty getting out as well in the morning.</li>
        <li>It wasn't until my later 20’s that I truly understood it had given me some underlying trauma even though I didn't understand it myself back then. But the feeling that someone actually could come in where you sleep, while you sleep, that’s a feeling I started my life experiencing.</li>
        <li>When my mother changed the lock, then the telephone harassment began. There was someone who called and breathed heavily into the receiver and made disgusting sexual noises almost daily. So my mother then had to change our phone number and list the new number as a hidden number from day one at the records.</li>
        <li>Then it became quiet. For a while we thought we had finally got rid of the problem.</li>
        <li>-The townhouse(rekkehus in Norwegian) we lived in, was built on a hill. Beneath, there was another townhouse-row. Our apartment was at the top of the 2 rows. In other words, the roof of the townhouse below us was about the same height as our floor height.
            Why am I telling you this? Because we realized the problem wasn't solved one evening when we looked out the window to admire the view, and on the roof of the townhouse below, we saw a man sitting completely naked, with binoculars and his back against he view, staring straight into our living-room watching us. It was at this point we realized that it was the neighbor who gave us the keys when we moved in that is the man behind it all. That he had copied a set to himself when he was holding the keys for the previous owners.</li>
        <li>It was quite obvious  to understand as i he sat completely naked on the roof watching us. He got scared when I saw that we saw him and climbed down from the roof. My mother reported him to the police, but little was done as there was no evidence.</li>
        <li>After this event it became quiet again and it stopped. The last event that happened to my knowledge, was much later and we were about to move out from this apartment and into a new house. A nice summer day, my mother had just picked me up from kindergarten, and we parked the car at home.
            There on the common grass of these townhouses, this neighbor is again naked, mowing the grass. And when he sees us, he shows himself off to us. This makes my mother furious, and it made her charge him and push him to the ground and yells at him to get away get dressed.</li>
        <li>And just days after, we moved to the new address, and it was also the end of all terrorizing from this man for good. We never saw or heard from him again.</li>
