Allwin Webpage 2.0 <Freely distributable>   Desember 05th, 2023

*********************************************************



A webpage that includes all the developer-knowledge i has so far.


Special Note:

I have been experimenting with different logics in other versions.

Since it's to show my spectrum of knowledge the programming also has different styles. Like the "my-page" is position Absolute on allmost everything and changes to grid and a burger when screen-size goes tablet or smaller. So two different html's to make that possible. But most other pages has grid/flex, one html thats scalable.

Exit buttons have a alternative way of working also, when clicking it finds the parent and removes the show-class or in games it removes the whole html from it's parent.


Author && Developer: Martin K. H. Stadheim

System Requirements:

Any computer that has a web-browser and a screen


Concept:

A kind of Finn.no, catalog for all kinds of products and next is to add a user-login-page.


Game rules:

Endless-runner: 
"up-arrow" to jump. 
"Space" to start game.

Snake:
Arrows to move.
Click "Gønne på" button to start.


Problems running games:

There is lacking knowledge from the developer on how to make the games without chatGPT to write 30% of the codes.
Therefore i'm not able to fix the bugs yet.
I included the games because it's shows i have learned to speek with chatGPT, and have a deeper understanding of 
how helpfull chatGPT really is, and what it can help with and what it can't help with.
